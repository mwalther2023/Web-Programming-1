For this project I decided to create a fan page of the videogame Destiny.
This fan page starts with a welcome page including a well known image used by the game.

The home page includes links to an about the game page, review the game page, a data page about gear in the game, and in the footer a link to the official Destiny page by Bungie.
Each page includes an image at the top with some being an iconic character from the game.

The about the game page includes information about the game and its setting cited from Wikipedia with a link to the page in the footer.

The review page houses a form for users to fill out their information, select their favorite locations and gamemodes, and a text area for any additional thoughts.
Submitting the form sends the user to a page displaying that the form was successfully submitted inluding a link to return to the home page.

Finally the data page displays some basic information about weapons and armor available in the game. 
The format used to showcase the info is a table, one for the guns available and another for armor across all 3 classes the player can choose
