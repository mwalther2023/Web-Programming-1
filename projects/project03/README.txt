For this project I added CSS styling to the fan page of the videogame Destiny that I created in Project01 then improved with JavaScript in Project02.
This fan page starts with a welcome page including a well known image used by the game. 


The home page includes links to an about the game page, review the game page, a data page about gear in the game, a page about the locations in the game, and in the footer a link to the official Destiny page by Bungie.
Using CSS I added a background image then changed the font color to be readable with the new background. I then made the links to connecting pages a list of tabs across the top.
The Bungie link at the bottom of the page has styling for if its been visited or not, and when you hover over or focus the link.
Each page includes a background image with some being an iconic character or location from the game.

The about the game page includes information about the game and its setting cited from Wikipedia with a link to the page in the footer.
In this page I added a section for the DLC released for the game which utilized JavaScript to add the information about each DLC.
Clicking on each DLC title will add a bullet point containing the information about the DLC, clicking the title again will remove the information to hide the bullet point.
Using CSS I changed the font-family and the color of the text with the <p> elements having a different font than the headers. This page also includes a background image and the tab links to connecting pages.

In the locations page there is a bullet point list of the current locations in Destiny 2.
Using JavaScript added functionality that when clicking each bullet point a window alert will appear containing information about the location.
This page was given a background image and a new font color to be readable.

The review page houses a form for users to fill out their information, select their favorite locations and gamemodes, and a text area for any additional thoughts.
This page received a confimation window alet through JavaScript when clicking the submit or reset buttons. Agreeing to clicking the resepective button will trigger their purpose while canceling will return to the form without changing.
Submitting the form sends the user to a submission page displaying that the form was successfully submitted inluding a link to return to the home page.
This page recieved a background image to start then the input fields were given a border and background color. The entered text was given a new color and the buttons for submission or reset were given a new background and font color.

On the submission page the user can enter their name and email to "sign up" for a newsletter, I used JavaScript here to take the data inputed to then display the User info to the page and save it to an object.
This page was given the same styling to the input fields as the review page and a new background image.

Finally the data page displays some basic information about weapons and armor available in the game. 
The format used to showcase the info is a table, one for the guns available and another for armor across all 3 classes the player can choose
With CSS the tables in this page were styled with each cell being given a background color based on their row number, whether it is even or odd.
Table header rows and columns were given a different color from the rest of the table and the font color was changed to be more readable with the new background color.
